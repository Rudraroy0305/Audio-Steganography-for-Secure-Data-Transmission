# Audio-Steganography-for-Secure-Data-Transmission

A MATLAB-based project demonstrating data concealment using audio steganography through the Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding technique. The system embeds secret text messages into audio signals without perceptible quality loss, verified using Signal-to-Quantization Noise Ratio (SQNR) analysis. This project highlights how audio signals can securely transmit hidden information, maintaining high fidelity and stealth in communication.
